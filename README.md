## My process

### Built with

- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JQuery for Interatability
- JSON Files

### What I learned

- I learned how to work with a local JSON file. I was able to create a website that feels like it's actually 8 different pages, but it is really one page where the content updates dynamically.

### Continued development

- I would like to continue working on my SCSS skills and possibly improve my workflow for it.
